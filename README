A. Description
****************
The Blob storage generic API provides a set of generic methods which can be used to develop
generic blob storage applications. These applications can be deployed remotely on PaaS clouds 
with no change in the source code. The user needs only to configure the class path of the generic
application to use a specific adapter.

An automatic Adapter Generation (AAG) module has been designed to automatically generate specific 
adapters for a generic API.

So, The AAG module has been used to generated adapters for the blob storage generic API for both 
GAE and Windows Azure.

This application provides the GAE and Azure adapters for the blob stroage generic API.
